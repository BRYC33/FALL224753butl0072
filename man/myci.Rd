\title{Calculate a 95% Confidence Interval for the Mean of a Single Sample}
\usage{
myci(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the sample data.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 containing the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.
}
\description{
Computes a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a single numeric sample using the t-distribution.
}
\details{
This function calculates the sample mean and standard error, and uses the t-distribution
to compute the 95% confidence interval. It assumes the sample is drawn from a normally distributed
population or that the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with a random sample
set.seed(23)
x <- rnorm(30, mean = 10, sd = 12)
myci(x)
